    "# Multiple Linear Regression for Robot Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will illustrate the use of multiple linear regression for calibrating robot control.  In addition to reviewing the concepts in the multiple linear regression demo `demo1_diabetes.ipynb`, you will see how to use multiple linear regression for time series data -- an important concept in dynamical systems such as robotics.\n",

    "The robot data for the lab is taken generously from the TU Dortmund's [Multiple Link Robot Arms Project](http://www.rst.e-technik.tu-dortmund.de/cms/en/research/robotics/TUDOR_engl/index.html).  As part of the project, they have created an excellent public dataset: [MERIt](http://www.rst.e-technik.tu-dortmund.de/cms/en/research/robotics/TUDOR_engl/index.html#h3MERIt) -- A Multi-Elastic-Link Robot Identification Dataset that can be used for understanding robot dynamics.  The data is from a three link robot:\n",

This is just one of many parameters that you might want to build an ML model to predict.  For example, it might be part of a larger system to predict the overall robot power consumption."
